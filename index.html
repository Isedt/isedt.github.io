  <h1>Manifesto for a Radical Ethics of Clarity</h1>

  <p>We live in a time where pleasure is mandated and distraction is engineered. Social media, pandemic isolation, and consumer capitalism have formed a hedonism cloudâ€”a fog that numbs us into complacency, masks power, and fractures our sense of self.</p>

  <p>But this cloud is not the whole story. To live meaningfully today, we must see clearly.</p>

  <h2>1. See the System</h2>
  <p>Our desires and distractions are shaped by invisible structures: algorithms that harvest our attention, media that manufacture consent, and economic forces that commodify our time and identity.</p>
  <p><strong>Knowledge is the first resistance.</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Confront the Contradiction</h2>
  <p>Our pleasure is not pure freedomâ€”it is a form of compulsive enjoyment, a trap we participate in without realizing. To break free, we must face the discomfort of boredom, uncertainty, and emptiness.</p>
  <p><strong>True freedom begins with embracing discomfort.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. Act Ethically, Even Imperfectly</h2>
  <p>Despite systemic pressures and ideological traps, we retain the power to choose actions that reduce harm and build solidarity. Ethics is not purity; it is a continual struggle to act responsibly in a flawed world.</p>
  <p><strong>Small acts of conscious resistance ripple outward.</strong></p>

  <h2>4. Build Collective Meaning</h2>
  <p>Alienation is overcome not through isolated self-improvement, but through shared struggle, mutual aid, and communities that nurture growth beyond consumption and spectacle.</p>
  <p><strong>Together, we reclaim our agency.</strong></p>

  <div class="final-call">
    <h2>Final Call</h2>
    <p>This is not a call for easy answers or perfect lives. It is an invitation to radical clarity: to see how we are shaped, to acknowledge our complicity, and to act anywayâ€”willing to endure discomfort, to question our desires, and to create meaning beyond the hedonism cloud.</p>
